<P> The 1-paragraph elevator speech description goes here.

<P> To access our system, please click or navigate to the following url, <a href="https://tigerteams.herokuapp.com"> https://tigerteams.herokuapp.com</a>, and login in with your netid and username for Princeton University.

<p> Provide passwords, including administrative access, if we will need them
to experiment with your system.

<i> Please make this as easy for us as possible.</i>  There are 30 projects so if
we have to blow 15 minutes figuring out how to run each system, that's one day wasted.

<P> If something goes wrong, please contact Avinash Boppana at aboppana@princeton.edu. Additional contacts include William Ughetta at wcu@princeton.edu, and Michael Hallee at mdhallee@princeton.edu.

<blockquote>
<P> <a href="https://tigerteams.herokuapp.com/"> A link to your project's web page</a>
or home page or the like: the place to find all public information
about your project.
This may be the same link as the "how to access a running version"
page.
The 
 <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring19/cos333/demosched19.html">
link on the course web page</a> should point there too.



<P> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sgaLTMgsOzRFaRxeKVhgN1Iq8u_zJwKqbzVZt8ZpuVg/edit?usp=sharing">report.pdf</a>.  Note: PDF only!

<P> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w95Q3IAgVmT5m5KEAc90PdvekQ7HPKvggfc0l7IwxI8/edit?usp=sharing">productguide.pdf</a>.  Note: PDF only!

<P> Links to anything else, either in your submission itself or to your web
page.

</blockquote>

<P> The report and product guide links must point to PDF files <b>with <i>exactly</i> the
specified names, all lower case</b>.  
They must not require logging into some place like Google Docs or
GitHub.  We need all submission materials in one place and completely
uniform at this level so we can access the pieces easily.

Thanks.
