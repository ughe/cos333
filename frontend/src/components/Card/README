Experience:

Working with the server to achieve an echo response of a query was pretty easy, 
and utilizing sqlite wasn't too much of a challenge either.  The hardest part of 
this first phase was figuring out the structure of the json field and how to 
query it.  The browser interface was extremely time consuming and challenging 
for me, though this was more a reflection of what I wanted the site to look
like, which required a lot of css gymnastics.  I also ran into an issue where I 
was using the python3 version of a simplehttpserver and it wasn't serving 
images from the local directory properly, and it wasn't until after quite a 
while that i gave up trying to figure out why/how to get around it and just
went to the recomeneded python 2 format. 

Hosting was mostly straightforward after I found a good guide on the heroku 
website and ironed out some bugs with the file structure it requires and
the dependencies and dynamically allocated port number.

What I wish I knew:

-doing the css is best with a small library or doing it yourself for an 
application like this
-go for the simplest and most functional design: not your own personal dream
design like I did
